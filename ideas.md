🔚 Summary
Yes, you can mix U-Net, SE, and WaveBlock features as long as you ensure matching shapes in time and channels before combining. The cleanest way is usually to:

Keep SE inside other blocks

Run WaveNet-style convolutions in parallel

Fuse all via concatenation before your recurrent head

Let me know if you want a code sketch combining U-Net + SE + WaveBlock + GRU — it's a nice pattern.

You said:
Ok so you're suggesting that I keep the high-evel architecture of the unet but I change how the layers work by adding more complex blocks. Use SE blocks for the encoder, use a transformer for the bottleneck and another se_block for the decoder. In parallel use a wave_block and feed all of it to a bi rnn

1) Label Smoothing
2) Mixup, CutMix and blend
3) New features


1. IMU Signal Processing Optimization (Core Improvement)
Implemented Features:

Derived kinematic metrics:
Acceleration vector magnitude (acc_mag)
Scalar rotation angle (rot_angle)
Acceleration derivative (acc_mag_jerk)
Angular velocity (rot_angle_vel)
Initial learning rate reduction from 1e-3 to 5e-4
Implemented cosine decay scheduling:
Parameters: first_decay_steps = 15 × steps_per_epoch

IDEAS FOR FEATURES

🔁 1. Signal Energy
Measures how intense the movement is over time. Useful for detecting bouts of motion.

Energy of acceleration components:

You can compute this over sliding windows or per sequence.

📈 2. Signal Entropy (Shannon or Approximate)
Captures unpredictability/irregularity of the signal. Could help distinguish involuntary vs deliberate motion.

Can be calculated on acc_mag, linear_acc_mag, or angular_distance.

⚡ 3. Signal Spectral Features (FFT-based)
Very powerful for detecting repetitive behaviors like tapping or shaking.

Dominant frequency in acc_mag, angular_distance, or linear_acc_mag

Spectral entropy

Power in frequency bands (e.g., 0–2 Hz, 2–5 Hz)

You could compute these over each sequence or using a short sliding window with overlap.

🔄 4. Orientation Features (Euler angles)
Convert quaternions to roll, pitch, yaw and derive:

d/dt of roll, pitch, yaw (angular velocities)

Magnitude of change in orientation

This is often more interpretable than raw quaternions or angular velocity vectors.

🧭 5. Tilt Angles
Compute:

Inclination / elevation angle: angle between gravity and device z-axis

Can be derived from accelerometer or rotation quaternion

Useful to detect gestures like hand-raising, bowing, etc.

🪢 6. Cross-axis Correlations
Correlations between axes:

acc_x vs acc_y

linear_acc_z vs angular_vel_z

Can be used as a proxy for coordinated movement

🧮 7. Rolling Stats
Add rolling window versions (e.g., window=5 or 10 samples) of:

mean, std, min, max, median

Especially on acc_mag, linear_acc_mag, angular_distance

These give temporal context and help capture transient changes.

🤖 8. Zero Crossing Rate
Count the number of times a signal crosses zero in a sequence (useful for oscillatory motion).
Apply to:

acc_x, acc_y, angular_vel_z, etc.

🔍 9. Jerk Vector Components
You already compute acc_mag_jerk, but jerk is a vector:

Compute d/dt of acc_x, acc_y, acc_z directly

Optionally add jerk magnitude

🧷 10. Posture Stability or Stationarity
Flag periods of low movement or stationary orientation:

Standard deviation of acc_mag or angular_distance below a threshold

Could create a binary "stationary" feature

Would you like me to implement one or more of these in your Polars feature pipeline?
For instance, I can extend it with:

Spectral features (via scipy.fft)

Orientation angles (via quaternion to Euler conversion)

Tilt angle estimation
Just let me know which direction you're most interested in.

====================================

Category 1: Features for the "C" Dimension (Per-Timestep)
These features can be calculated for each row (timestep) and added as new columns to your processed_df. They fit perfectly into a (Batch, Timesteps, Features) tensor for models like LSTMs, GRUs, or Transformers.
Idea 1: Rolling Window Statistics on Existing Features
Concept: Instead of just the raw value or the instantaneous derivative (jerk), calculate statistics over a small sliding window (e.g., 5, 10, or 20 timesteps). This captures the local signal texture.
Assessment: Highly recommended. This is one of the most powerful techniques for time-series classification. It smooths out noise and creates features that describe local trends (mean), volatility (std), and range (max-min).
Overlap: It's a different, more stable representation of signal dynamics than jerk. While jerk captures instantaneous change, rolling standard deviation captures "shakiness" over a short period. They are complementary.
Implementation: Can be implemented very efficiently in Polars using rolling_ expressions.
code
Python
# In your main feature engineering function, after calculating base features:
window_sizes = [10, 20] # e.g., 100ms and 200ms windows
rolling_features = []

# On IMU features
cols_to_roll = ["acc_mag", "linear_acc_mag", "angular_vel_mag"]
for w in window_sizes:
    for col in cols_to_roll:
        rolling_features.append(pl.col(col).rolling_mean(window_size=w, min_periods=1).over("sequence_id").alias(f"{col}_roll_mean_{w}"))
        rolling_features.append(pl.col(col).rolling_std(window_size=w, min_periods=1).over("sequence_id").alias(f"{col}_roll_std_{w}"))
        rolling_features.append(pl.col(col).rolling_max(window_size=w, min_periods=1).over("sequence_id").alias(f"{col}_roll_max_{w}"))

df = df.with_columns(rolling_features)
Idea 2: Features from Thermopile (thm_) and Time-of-Flight (tof_) Sensors
Concept: The IMU tells you how the hand is moving. The ToF and Thm sensors tell you what the hand is near. This is critical for distinguishing a hand-to-face BFRB from a simple wave. You should create summary statistics across these sensors for each timestep.
Assessment: Essential. The competition explicitly states that half the test set is IMU-only to see if these sensors help. This implies they are very important. Ignoring them is leaving performance on the table.
Overlap: Zero overlap with IMU features. This is entirely new, complementary information.
Implementation: You can calculate the mean, std, min, and max across the 5 thermopiles and across all 320 ToF pixels at each timestep.
code
Python
# In your main feature engineering function:
thm_cols = [c for c in df.columns if c.startswith('thm_')]
tof_cols = [c for c in df.columns if c.startswith('tof_')]

df = df.with_columns(
    pl.mean_horizontal(pl.col(thm_cols)).alias("thm_mean"),
    pl.std_horizontal(pl.col(thm_cols)).alias("thm_std"),
    pl.mean_horizontal(pl.col(tof_cols)).alias("tof_mean"),
    pl.std_horizontal(pl.col(tof_cols)).alias("tof_std"),
    pl.max_horizontal(pl.col(tof_cols)).alias("tof_max"), # Max proximity reading
)


Category 2: Features Requiring a Different Workflow (Per-Sequence)
These features produce a single value or a set of values for an entire sequence. They cannot be added to the (B, T, C) tensor because they don't have a time dimension. They are static features for each sequence_id.
Idea 3: Aggregated Features Over the Entire Sequence
Concept: Calculate global statistics for each sequence. For example, the maximum acceleration magnitude over the whole sequence, the total change in orientation from start to end, or the standard deviation of the angular velocity.
Assessment: Very useful. These features provide a global summary of the event. A simple tabular model (like LightGBM or XGBoost) could work very well on these features alone. For a neural network, they provide powerful context.
Overlap: They are derived from the per-timestep features but represent a different level of abstraction (global vs. local).
Implementation: Create a separate DataFrame using a group_by("sequence_id").agg(...) operation.
code
Python
# This would be a separate step, creating a new DataFrame
agg_df = processed_df.group_by("sequence_id").agg(
    pl.col("acc_mag").max().alias("seq_acc_mag_max"),
    pl.col("acc_mag").mean().alias("seq_acc_mag_mean"),
    pl.col("linear_acc_mag").max().alias("seq_linear_acc_mag_max"),
    pl.col("angular_vel_mag").mean().alias("seq_angular_vel_mag_mean"),
    pl.col("tof_mean").quantile(0.75).alias("seq_tof_mean_q75"),
    # Add any other global stats you can think of
)
Idea 4: Features from Demographic Data
Concept: Use the demographics.csv file. Features like age, sex, handedness, and shoulder_to_wrist_cm could influence how gestures are performed.
Assessment: Recommended. These are classic static features that can improve model performance by providing context about the subject.
Overlap: No overlap with sensor data.
Implementation: Load demographics.csv and join it to your aggregated features DataFrame.
code
Python
# After creating agg_df from Idea 3
demographics_df = pl.read_csv("path/to/train_demographics.csv")

# You'll need to join this to your main data first to get subject ID per sequence
seq_to_subject = processed_df.select(["sequence_id", "subject"]).unique()

# Join the aggregated features with the subject ID
agg_df = agg_df.join(seq_to_subject, on="sequence_id")

# Join with demographics
final_static_df = agg_df.join(demographics_df, on="subject")
